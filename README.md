# r Leaflet Mapping

The code included in the 'app' file is an example Shiny appy which uses the package Leaflet to plot UK Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) geographical boundary data by Clinical Commissioning Group.

Also included is a markdown file with some more detailed comments.

Below are screen shots of the (current) final product...
